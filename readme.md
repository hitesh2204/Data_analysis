Assessing Data
Assessing data is a crucial step in the data analysis process. It involves gaining a deeper understanding of the data before implementing methods to clean it. By assessing the data, you can identify any issues or patterns that may affect the analysis process 
.
Types of Unclean Data
There are two main types of unclean data: dirty data and messy data.
1. Dirty Data
Dirty data, also known as low-quality data, refers to data that has content issues. It may contain duplicated data, missing data, corrupt data, or inaccurate data 
.
2. Messy Data
Messy data, also known as untidy data, refers to data that has structural issues. Tidy data should have each variable forming a column, each observation forming a row, and each observational unit forming a table.
Types of Assessment
There are two types of assessment styles that can be used to assess data:
Manual Assessment: This involves looking through the data manually, often using tools like Google Sheets, to gain insights and identify any issues 
.
Programmatic Assessment: This involves using programming tools and functions, such as pandas functions like info(), describe(), or sample(), to analyze and assess the data.
Steps in Assessment
The assessment process typically involves two steps:
Discover: This step focuses on exploring the data and gaining a better understanding of its content, structure, and potential issues. It may involve examining data summaries, visualizations, and statistical measures 
.
Document: This step involves documenting the findings from the assessment process. It includes recording any issues or patterns identified, as well as any insights gained from the data.
Data Quality Dimensions
During the assessment process, it is important to consider various dimensions of data quality. Some common data quality dimensions include:
Completeness Issues: This refers to missing or incomplete data that may affect the analysis and interpretation 
.
Validity Issues: This refers to data that does not conform to the defined rules or constraints, leading to inconsistencies or inaccuracies.
Accuracy Issues: This refers to data that contains errors or inaccuracies, which can impact the reliability of the analysis 
.
Consistency Issues: This refers to data that is inconsistent or contradictory, either within the dataset or when compared to external sources.
